# VR Pod Racer Demo

This is a demo of a Pod Racing game developed in Unreal Engine 4.26.2 for PC VR. Works with the Oculus Quest 2.

The demo contains one track and one racing pod. The objective is simply to complete the track in the shortest time possible. The pod can be controlled using the Oculus controllers, an Xbox Gamepad or the PC keyboard.

**NOTE:** The textures are not included in this repo for storage limitation reasons. To have the project show the textures correctly, the textures have to be downlaoded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-HID70M08jCBQw99-u6n4rqdrDAryzl6/view?usp=sharing), and then extracted in the `Content/Textures/` folder.
